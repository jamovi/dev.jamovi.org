A **plot module** is a module that appears under the **Plots** tab in jamovi rather than the **Analyses** tab. The technical change is small — a single `category: plots` field — but the *editorial* expectation is significant: the Plots tab is reserved for modules whose primary purpose is producing a plot.

> Before reaching for `category: plots`, read the next section. Putting a non-plotting module in the Plots tab makes the tab harder to navigate for end users, and is the most common reason a plot module is rejected from the jamovi library.

## Should Your Module Be a Plot Module?

A module belongs in the Plots tab **only if its primary output is a plot**.

**Use a plot module when:**

- The user opens the module specifically to *see a visualization* (scatter plot, histogram, bar chart).
- Any tables or text in the results are supporting context (axis info, group summaries, captions) — not the main payload.
- A reasonable user would describe the module as *"a plot"*, not *"an analysis that includes a plot"*.

**Do not use a plot module when:**

- The module computes a statistical test or model and happens to include a plot among its outputs.
- The interpretation or numerical results are the headline; the plot is illustrative.
- The module would feel out of place sitting next to *Scatter Plot* and *Histogram* in a list of plots.

When in doubt, ship it as a regular analysis module. Plot modules **can** still return tables and text — the constraint isn't technical, it's about user intent. If the user is going to the Plots tab to find your module, it's a plot module.

## Registering a Plot Module

Set `category: plots` in two places.

### 1. Module level — `jamovi/0000.yaml`

```yaml
---
name: myplots
title: My Plots
version: 1.0.0
jms: '1.0'
category: plots
authors:
  - Your Name
description: >-
  A collection of plots built on ggplot2.
```

### 2. Per analysis — each `.a.yaml`

```yaml
---
name:  scatter
title: Scatter Plot
category: plots
menuGroup: .
version: '1.0.0'
jas: '1.2'
```

The special value `menuGroup: .` places the analysis at the root of the Plots tab. Use a named subgroup (e.g., `menuGroup: More`) to nest plots under a subheading.

## Reference Implementation

[`jamovi/jmvplots`](https://github.com/jamovi/jmvplots) — the plots bundled with jamovi — is the reference plot module. Study its `.a.yaml` files to see `category: plots` and `menuGroup` in context.
